  TOPIC: What is JavaScript
*****************************************/
/*
 * A variable is a “named storage” for data. 
 * There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:
    1. The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
    2. The first character must not be a digit.
 * Case matters
 * Non-Latin letters are allowed, but not recommended
 */

/*
  - We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords.
    let – is a modern variable declaration.
    var – is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all, but we’ll cover subtle differences from let in the chapter The old "var", just in case you need them.
    const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.
  - Variables should be named in a way that allows us to easily understand what’s inside them.
