  TOPIC: What is JavaScript
*****************************************/
/*
 * The programs in this language are called scripts.
 * Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
 * Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.
 * JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines HTML/CSS/JS
 */

/*
// Engines 
The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the script.
Then it converts (“compiles”) the script to the machine language.
And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.
