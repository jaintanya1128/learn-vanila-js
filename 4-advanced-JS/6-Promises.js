  TOPIC: Promises
*****************************************/
/*
- Normally code is synchronous - one statement executes and there is a guarantee that the next statement will execute immediately afterwards
- With asynchronous operations, you should assume that you have no idea when the operation will complete. 
  You can't even assume that just because you send out one request first, and another request second, that they will return in that order
- Callbacks are the standard way of handling asynchronous code in JavaScript, but promises are the best way to handle asynchronous code. 
  This is because callbacks make error handling difficult, and lead to ugly nested code.
